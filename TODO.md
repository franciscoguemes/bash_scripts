TODOs
=================================================================

 - Go through all the scripts in the directory `to_review` and separate the ones that are production ready from a functional point of view from the ones that are not. Move the ones that are ready to the `general_purpose` directory.
 - Review the script `install.sh` and review if it makes sense at all. Probably the installation has to be done by mylicula or se4mylicula
 - Review the scripts in the directory `general_purpose` and format them according to the bash scripts standards.
