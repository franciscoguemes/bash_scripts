TODOs
=================================================================

 - Go through all the scripts in the folder `general_purpose` and separate the ones that are production ready from a functional point of view from the ones that are not
 - Review the script `install.sh` and review if it makes sense at all. Probably the installation has to be done by mylicula or se4mylicula
