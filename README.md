# bash_scripts

This project contains a collecion of multipurpose bash scripts that I use under Ubuntu Linux.


## Requirements

The scripts are coded in:
 - [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) 4.X or above
 - [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.X or above


You can check which version of bash you have installed in your system by using any of the two commands below:
```bash
# General way of checking your bash version
bash --version
# Get only bash version number
echo "${BASH_VERSION}"
```

In the case of Python you can check your installed versions by typing:
```bash
# For python 2.X versions
python --version
# For python 3.X versions
python3 --version
```
