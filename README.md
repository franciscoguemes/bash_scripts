bash_scripts
=======================================================

This project contains a collecion of multipurpose bash scripts that I use under Ubuntu Linux.

## Structure of the project

The project is structured in the following directories:

```bash
tree -L 2 .
.
├── general_purpose
│   ├── bash
│   ├── python
│   └── to_review
├── install.sh
└── README.md
```

The _general_purpose_ directory contains scripts that will be often called from the command line and therefore are subtle to be included in the `$PATH` variable of your OS.
